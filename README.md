# Yelp-Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis

The objective of the project was to perform sentiment analysis and classify reviews as positive or negative based on the Document-Term Matrix of the reviews.

The Document-Term Matrix (DTM) from a Yelp Reviews Dataset. This was done using R, all stop words/punctuations/conjugations were removed.

Then, the 3 algorithms - Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machines and Artificial Neural Networks were used. 

The Random Forest gives us the highest accuracy, around 78%. ANN gives us a slightly lower accuracy of 75%. All the 3 algorithms have approximately the same accuracy around 75%.
Here, no overfitting occurs as the accuracy is not perfect, rather is at an optimal amount of 75% , which allows maximum number of correct prediction with some room for misclassification.
ANN gives us maximum AUC for the ROC curve at 0.877.
Out of the 3 models, ANN runs the slowest because of its large computation power. Random forest is a type of ensemble learning so it runs relatively slower.

Sentiment analysis is hard due to things such as subjectivity, tone, lack of context, irony, and sarcasm. 
So, itâ€™s not only hard for algorithms to do sentiment analysis but also for humans. 
Therefore any accuracy within the range of 60 to 80% is considered good.
